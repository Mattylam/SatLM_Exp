{"id": "cot", "style_template": "cot", "prompt": "Q: A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The grasshopper winks at the canary. The sun bear does not remove from the board one of the pieces of the canary. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: For the canary, if the belief is that the sun bear does not offer a job to the canary but the grasshopper winks at the canary, then you can add \"the canary removes one of the pieces of the aardvark\" to your conclusions. Rule2: If at least one animal shows her cards (all of them) to the pig, then the canary does not remove from the board one of the pieces of the aardvark. Rule1 is preferred over Rule2. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the canary remove from the board one of the pieces of the aardvark?\nA: The provided information is not enough to prove or disprove the statement \"the canary removes from the board one of the pieces of the aardvark\". The answer is unknown.\n\nQ: A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The amberjack learns the basics of resource management from the spider, needs support from the starfish, and rolls the dice for the hummingbird. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: Be careful when something learns elementary resource management from the spider and also needs support from the starfish because in this case it will surely remove from the board one of the pieces of the elephant (this may or may not be problematic). Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the amberjack remove from the board one of the pieces of the elephant?\nA: We know the amberjack learns the basics of resource management from the spider and the amberjack needs support from the starfish, and according to Rule1 \"if something learns the basics of resource management from the spider and needs support from the starfish, then it removes from the board one of the pieces of the elephant\", so we can conclude \"the amberjack removes from the board one of the pieces of the elephant\". So the statement \"the amberjack removes from the board one of the pieces of the elephant\" is proved. The answer is yes.\n\nQ: A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The kangaroo gives a magnifier to the doctorfish, and has 16 friends. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: Regarding the kangaroo, if it has a card whose color is one of the rainbow colors, then we can conclude that it knocks down the fortress that belongs to the moose. Rule2: If the kangaroo has fewer than 6 friends, then the kangaroo knocks down the fortress of the moose. Rule3: If something gives a magnifier to the doctorfish, then it does not knock down the fortress that belongs to the moose. Rule1 is preferred over Rule3. Rule2 is preferred over Rule3. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the kangaroo knock down the fortress of the moose?\nA: We know the kangaroo gives a magnifier to the doctorfish, and according to Rule3 \"if something gives a magnifier to the doctorfish, then it does not knock down the fortress of the moose\", and for the conflicting and higher priority rule Rule1 we cannot prove the antecedent \"the kangaroo has a card whose color is one of the rainbow colors\" and for Rule2 we cannot prove the antecedent \"the kangaroo has fewer than 6 friends\", so we can conclude \"the kangaroo does not knock down the fortress of the moose\". So the statement \"the kangaroo knocks down the fortress of the moose\" is disproved. The answer is no.\n\nQ: A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The aardvark becomes an enemy of the halibut, and is named Meadow. The aardvark has a card that is orange in color. The goldfish is named Mojo. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: Regarding the aardvark, if it has a card with a primary color, then we can conclude that it owes money to the meerkat. Rule2: If the aardvark has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the goldfish's name, then the aardvark owes $$$ to the meerkat. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the aardvark owe money to the meerkat?\nA: We know the aardvark is named Meadow and the goldfish is named Mojo, both names start with \"M\", and according to Rule2 \"if the aardvark has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the goldfish's name, then the aardvark owes money to the meerkat\", so we can conclude \"the aardvark owes money to the meerkat\". So the statement \"the aardvark owes money to the meerkat\" is proved. The answer is yes.\n\nQ: A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The gecko has a card that is yellow in color. The gecko published a high-quality paper. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If the gecko has a card whose color starts with the letter \"e\", then the gecko does not give a magnifying glass to the swordfish. Rule2: If the gecko has a high-quality paper, then the gecko does not give a magnifying glass to the swordfish. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the gecko give a magnifier to the swordfish?\nA: We know the gecko published a high-quality paper, and according to Rule2 \"if the gecko has a high-quality paper, then the gecko does not give a magnifier to the swordfish\", so we can conclude \"the gecko does not give a magnifier to the swordfish\".
