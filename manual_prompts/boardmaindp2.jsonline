{"id": "cot", "style_template": "cot", "prompt": "Q: A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The cat is named Meadow. The cat published a high-quality paper. The gecko winks at the eagle. The puffin is named Peddi. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: Regarding the cat, if it has a high-quality paper, then we can conclude that it prepares armor for the canary. Rule2: If you are positive that you saw one of the animals rolls the dice for the eagle, you can be certain that it will also proceed to the spot right after the sun bear. Rule3: If the cat prepares armor for the canary and the cricket gives a magnifier to the canary, then the canary will not remove one of the pieces of the aardvark. Rule4: If the cat has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the puffin's name, then the cat does not prepare armor for the canary. Rule5: The canary removes one of the pieces of the aardvark whenever at least one animal proceeds to the spot right after the sun bear. Rule6: Regarding the cat, if it has something to sit on, then we can conclude that it does not prepare armor for the canary. Rule3 is preferred over Rule5. Rule4 is preferred over Rule1. Rule6 is preferred over Rule1. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the canary remove from the board one of the pieces of the aardvark?\nA: The provided information is not enough to prove or disprove the statement \"the canary removes from the board one of the pieces of the aardvark\". The answer is unknown.\n\nQ: A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The crocodile knocks down the fortress of the kudu. The octopus knocks down the fortress of the amberjack. The raven raises a peace flag for the amberjack. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If at least one animal steals five points from the spider, then the amberjack removes one of the pieces of the elephant. Rule2: Be careful when something rolls the dice for the moose and also becomes an enemy of the eel because in this case it will surely not remove one of the pieces of the elephant (this may or may not be problematic). Rule3: If something knocks down the fortress that belongs to the kudu, then it steals five points from the spider, too. Rule4: For the amberjack, if the belief is that the raven raises a flag of peace for the amberjack and the octopus knocks down the fortress of the amberjack, then you can add \"the amberjack rolls the dice for the moose\" to your conclusions. Rule5: If something shows her cards (all of them) to the turtle, then it does not steal five of the points of the spider. Rule2 is preferred over Rule1. Rule5 is preferred over Rule3. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the amberjack remove from the board one of the pieces of the elephant?\nA: We know the crocodile knocks down the fortress of the kudu, and according to Rule3 \"if something knocks down the fortress of the kudu, then it steals five points from the spider\", and for the conflicting and higher priority rule Rule5 we cannot prove the antecedent \"the crocodile shows all her cards to the turtle\", so we can conclude \"the crocodile steals five points from the spider\". We know the crocodile steals five points from the spider, and according to Rule1 \"if at least one animal steals five points from the spider, then the amberjack removes from the board one of the pieces of the elephant\", and for the conflicting and higher priority rule Rule2 we cannot prove the antecedent \"the amberjack becomes an enemy of the eel\", so we can conclude \"the amberjack removes from the board one of the pieces of the elephant\". So the statement \"the amberjack removes from the board one of the pieces of the elephant\" is proved. The answer is yes.\n\nQ: A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The gecko has 13 friends, and hates Chris Ronaldo. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If the gecko has more than 8 friends, then the gecko does not proceed to the spot that is right after the spot of the bat. Rule2: Regarding the gecko, if it is a fan of Chris Ronaldo, then we can conclude that it does not proceed to the spot that is right after the spot of the bat. Rule3: If something does not proceed to the spot right after the bat, then it does not give a magnifier to the swordfish. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the gecko give a magnifier to the swordfish?\nA: We know the gecko has 13 friends, 13 is more than 8, and according to Rule1 \"if the gecko has more than 8 friends, then the gecko does not proceed to the spot right after the bat\", so we can conclude \"the gecko does not proceed to the spot right after the bat\". We know the gecko does not proceed to the spot right after the bat, and according to Rule3 \"if something does not proceed to the spot right after the bat, then it doesn't give a magnifier to the swordfish\", so we can conclude \"the gecko does not give a magnifier to the swordfish\". So the statement \"the gecko gives a magnifier to the swordfish\" is disproved. The answer is no.\n\nQ: A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The elephant attacks the green fields whose owner is the ferret. The penguin learns the basics of resource management from the cockroach. The sheep attacks the green fields whose owner is the gecko. The sheep holds the same number of points as the viperfish. The panda bear does not wink at the tilapia. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If the sheep sings a song of victory for the whale and the jellyfish removes one of the pieces of the whale, then the whale will not become an actual enemy of the rabbit. Rule2: If at least one animal attacks the green fields whose owner is the ferret, then the jellyfish removes one of the pieces of the whale. Rule3: If at least one animal learns elementary resource management from the cockroach, then the tilapia does not burn the warehouse of the whale. Rule4: If you see that something attacks the green fields whose owner is the gecko and holds an equal number of points as the viperfish, what can you certainly conclude? You can conclude that it also sings a victory song for the whale. Rule5: The tilapia unquestionably burns the warehouse of the whale, in the case where the panda bear does not wink at the tilapia. Rule3 is preferred over Rule5.

So the statement \"the whale becomes an enemy of the rabbit\" is disproved. The answer is no.\n\nQ: A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The aardvark has a card that is green in color. The aardvark holds the same number of points as the bat. The tilapia rolls the dice for the aardvark. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If something does not raise a flag of peace for the eagle, then it does not owe $$$ to the cockroach. Rule2: The aardvark unquestionably owes money to the cockroach, in the case where the tilapia rolls the dice for the aardvark. Rule3: If something holds the same number of points as the bat, then it rolls the dice for the goldfish, too. Rule4: If you see that something rolls the dice for the goldfish and owes money to the cockroach, what can you certainly conclude? You can conclude that it also owes $$$ to the meerkat. Rule5: Regarding the aardvark, if it has something to drink, then we can conclude that it does not know the defense plan of the halibut. Rule6: If the aardvark has a card whose color starts with the letter \"g\", then the aardvark knows the defense plan of the halibut. Rule7: If at least one animal learns elementary resource management from the squirrel, then the aardvark does not roll the dice for the goldfish. Rule1 is preferred over Rule2. Rule5 is preferred over Rule6. Rule7 is preferred over Rule3.
